# E07a-Save-and-Load    

Exercise 7a for my C220 class at Indiana University Bloomington. Here I practice saving state to a config file in Godot. There is a number you may make positive or negative, if you save at a certain number the number will reappear whenever you press the "load" button. Right now the value is saved at -3.
